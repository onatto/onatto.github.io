<h2>Notes on blog </h2>
<pre>Because that's how all blogs start after all, isn't it?

What I need from the blog generator is not much, I just want a navigation page to the blog posts and the date alongside the posts.
I've already got the markdown-style page generator with sectioning I've used for this site.
First section becomes the post title, dates are specified in the language rather than parsed in the post markdown.
This means I don't need to specify month/year all the time, just the day.
I don't need tags just yet, but adding them would be easy anyway, specified in the language again instead of parsed from text.
Instead of parsing all the posts and sorting them by reverse date, I just specify the post list in reverse order.
